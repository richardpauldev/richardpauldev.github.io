Hi, I'm Richard ‚Äî a software engineer and educator with a Master's in Computer Science from UMass Amherst and hands-on experience across DevOps, full-stack web development, cloud architecture, and CS education. I've done everything from building automation tools, managing infrastrucute, and teaching algorithms to middle schoolers. My goal is to work on technology that has a real-world impact, making sure the technology scales and functions seamlessly so the user doesn't have to worry about the details under the hood. 

Having expierence both in teaching and engineering, I've learnt to solve problems with code while communicating clearly with both technical exports and novice learners. For my personal projects, I have a strong interest in computer players for my personal favorite  games, which fits well into my interests in software engineering, simulation, gaming, statistics, LLMs and user interface design. Games that I have personally created tools or AIs for include: Blood on the Clocktower, Diplomacy, War of the Ring, Stardew Valley, Twilight Imperium, Lorcana, and Adventure Capitalist. 

## üß† Background

I hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I focused on Python development, cloud computing, and applied machine learning. During this time, I served as President of the UMass Board Game Club and developed a strong interest in creating engaging educational experiences ‚Äî both in the classroom and through software.

## üíº Work Highlights
