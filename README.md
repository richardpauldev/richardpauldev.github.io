# Richard Paul Resume Website

This repository contains the source for my personal resume and portfolio site built with Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme.

## Getting Started

1. Install Ruby and Bundler.
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview the site locally.

## Site Structure

- `index.html` – landing page with a short introduction and links to sections.
- `about.md` – my background, skills, and a link to download my resume.
- `projects.md` – highlights of selected projects.
- `_data/navigation.yml` – navigation links.

Feel free to use this structure as a starting point for your own resume site.
